# Fake Bot

## Description
You’ll write a *fake bot* to say hi when people visit your web page.

## Setup Instructions

1. All design is up to you, but remember, a fake bot should be pretty and friendly.

1. Create a local folder «assignment--fake-bot» in `~/muktek/assignments`

## Deliverables

+ A repository in GitHub.

## How this bot should work?

Each sentence should appear with one second of delay from last one.
Then, it must wait for user input.
And finally, say hello.

```
1. Hello, my name is «John».

2. I was an «Accountant Student», but right now I’m studying Web Development.

3. I like to watch movies and read books.

_A text input should appears and ask for User’s name_.
**After hit ENTER in the input text, the fake bot should validate a NO EMPTY box.**

(Condition: If name is longer than 6 characters it should be a LONG name, otherwise, SHORT name.)
4. That’s a (short|long) name.

5. Nice to meet you, «Lucy».
```
